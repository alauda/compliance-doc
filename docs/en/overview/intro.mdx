## Applicable Scenarios

- **Government and Defense Organizations**: Automated STIG compliance verification for DoD security requirements
- **Enterprise Security Teams**: Regular security baseline assessments and audit preparation
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Compliance scanning for containerized environments and MicroOS systems
- **DevSecOps Pipelines**: Integration of compliance checks into development and deployment workflows
